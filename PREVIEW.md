"A Midsummer's Night" - April 09, 2019

By: Emma Chen, Lauren Stanick, Ryan Ratley

In this current preview of our Twine game, the user is first given a choice between characters, boy or girl. 
This leads to the first convergence of passages, where the game begins. The user is then given a second choice: the activity that they will be participating in for the night. 
There are five choices available. Three of these choices will continue onto separate storylines and two of the choices lead back to the beginning of the game. 
Currently, the asylum choice/storyline has been worked on. The user needs to decide whether or not to tell their parents where they are going, which will be stored as a variable and used later in the story.
The user needs to find the key and unlock the entrance to the asylum. The user is also given a choice on whether or not to prop the asylum door open, or take the key. This will also be stored as a variable and will be used later in the storyline. 

The background colors of the story are also supposed to "set the tone" of the story. In the beginning, sunset colors are used to portray a "light-heartedness" for the story, and the white background is used before the story gets "dark".
The background colors of the story will change when the story become "creepy". 

Some things that need to be done include: figure out how to store variables, add some sounds to the passages, and set an automatic time delay to continue to the next passage. 
In addition, images will be added to the passages. Currently, the idea is to have stick figures to represent the characters of the game in the "Boy" or "Girl" passages. 

As for assets, there are no assets currently used/need to be credited, but we are unsure if the name "Oujia" can be used when talking about the "Oujia boardgame", as it is owned by Hasbro. A generic name can be used, but players may not recognize the generic name.
