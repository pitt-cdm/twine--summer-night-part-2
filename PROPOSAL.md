<!-- What's the basic pitch for the Twine narrative? Where do you start? Who do you play as? What's the genre? -->

This is more in the horror/thriller genre. You choose a character (out of two options), and from there you start the game.
Basic pitch - a summer night, and you need to decide what you and your friends want to do. Options can include exploring an abandoned building, you can play manhunt, etc.






<!-- What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through?

Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?

IMPORTANT: never include personal info like phone numbers on GitHub! -->

Overall mode of collaboration - by compromise and consensus, but also roles will be divided based on areas of expertise. Emma will do the initial outline (first Twine push). We will communicate via GroupMe.
Sounds/coding/imagery will be divided later.
